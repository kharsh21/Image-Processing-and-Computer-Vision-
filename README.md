# Image-Processing-and-Computer-Vision
# Objective
• Built a ML model for image enhancing, processing and segmentation to solve real world problems.

# Approach
• Explored techniques such as sampling, quantization, image enhancement, edge detection, and image segmentation.Utilized these techniques to manipulate, analyze, and extract meaningful information from images.

• Devloped ML model that could classify and segment images based on their respective categories using image segmentation. Outcome

# Outcome
• Built a ML model for image segmentation achieving optimum accuracy on a large dataset containing images of different categories. Attained accurate results in image enhancement, edge detection, and segmentation.
